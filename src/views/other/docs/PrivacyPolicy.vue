		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<span class="doc-v">v.1.0 - February 10, 2020</span>
		<p>
			ABCDEFG's Privacy Policy was last updated and went into effect <b>January 31, 2020</b>.
		</p>
		<h3 class="mtop-md">
			Your privacy is important. At ABCDEFG, there are a few fundamental principles:
		</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>
				<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>
				<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>
				<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>
				<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>
			</ul>
			Below is our complete Privacy Policy, which is centered around the list above.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			Who We Are and What This Policy Covers
		</h2>
		<p>
			Hi! We are the people running ABCDEFG. Our goal with ABCDEFG is to make ____________. We're doing that by ______________.
		</p>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:
			<ul>
				<li>ABCDEFG.com and all subdomains and domain variants.</li>
			</ul>
			Throughout this Privacy Policy, we'll refer to our website and other products and services collectively as "Services."
			Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			Information We Collect
		</h2>
		<p>
			We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so — for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
		</p>
		<p>
			We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources. Now we'll go over what we collect.
		</p>
		<h4 class="mtop-md">
			Information You Provide to Us
		</h4>
		<p>
			It's probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us. The amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information. Here are some examples:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Basic Account Information:</b> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a ABCDEFG.com account to provide an email address — and that's it. You may provide us with more information — like ____________ — after you create your account, but we don't require that information to create an account.</li>
				<li><b>Content Information:</b> Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in other forms (such as ________). For example, if ________!</li>
				<li><b>Communications With Us:</b> You may also provide us information when you contact support.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<!-- This section is only needed if you use cookies/tracking, most likely -->
		<h4 class="mtop-md">
			Information We Collect Automatically
		</h4>
		<p>
			We also collect some things automatically.
			<ul>
				<li><b>Log Information:</b> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services — for example, when you visit the home page, or when you read our Privacy Policy.</li>
				<li><b>Usage Information:</b> We collect information about your usage of our Services. For example, we collect information about the actions users perform on ABCDEFG.com — in other words, who did what, when, and to what thing on a site (e.g., [ABCDEFG.com User] signed in at [time/date]). We also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, features used by you, along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer). We use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better — for example, if we see a majoritty large users are accessing ABCDEFG on smartphones, we will focus on mobile first.</li>
				<li><b>Location Information:</b> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>
				<li><b>Information from Cookies & Other Technologies:</b> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. ABCDEFG uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads for some users.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<!-- End -->

		<!-- This section is likely only needed if you add social sign in services -->
		<h4 class="mtop-md">
			Information We Collect from Other Sources
		</h4>
		<p>
			We may also get information about you from other sources. For example, if you create or log into your ABCDEFG.com account through another service (like Google, Facebook, or Twitter), we will receive information from that service (such as your username, and some basic profile information) via the authorization procedures used by that service. The information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.
		</p>
		<!-- End -->


		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			How And Why We Use Information
		</h2>
		<h4 class="mtop-md">
			Purposes for Using Information
		</h4>
		<p>
			We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:
			<ul>
				<li>To provide our Services — for example, to set up and maintain your account, store your preferences, or host yourr profile at a public URL;</li>
				<li>To further develop and improve our Services — for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy;</li>
				<li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>
				<li>To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition — for example, we may analyze how many individuals tried out a new feature after receiving a marketing message;</li>
				<li>To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of ABCDEFG and others;</li>
				<li>To communicate with you, for example through an email, about offers or promotions related to ABCDEFG, to solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on ABCDEFG and our products; and</li>
				<li>To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations, target our marketing messages to groups of our users, and serve relevant advertisements to some users.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h4 class="mtop-md">
			Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information
		</h4>
		<p>
			A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:
			<ol>
				<li>The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under our Terms of Service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device; or</li>
				<li>The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or</li>
				<li>The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or</li>
				<li>We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience; or</li>
				<li>You have given us your consent.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			Sharing Information
		</h2>
		<h4 class="mtop-md">
			How We Share Information
		</h4>
		<p>
			We do not sell our users' private personal information. We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Employees, and Independent Contractors:</b> We may disclose information about you to our employees and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our employees and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>
				<li><b>Third Party Vendors:</b> We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you, those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you.</li>
				<li><b>Legal Requests:</b> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
				<li><b>To Protect Rights, Property, and Others:</b> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ABCDEFG, third parties, or the public at large. For example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>
				<li><b>Business Transfers:</b> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that ABCDEFG goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
				<li><b>With Your Consent:</b> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.</li>
				<li><b>Published Support Requests:</b> And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h4 class="mtop-md">
			Information Shared Publicly
		</h4>
		<p>
			Information that you choose to make public is — as the word public implies — disclosed publicly. That means, of course, that information like your public profile and any content included on it will be available to others. Public information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			How Long We Keep Information
		</h2>
		<p>
			We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it–which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information–and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of ABCDEFG's websites, such as the visitor's IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to ABCDEFG websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			Security
		</h2>
		<p>
			While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			Choices
		</h2>
		<p>
			You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Limit the Information that You Provide:</b> You are free to use ABCDEFG without an account. If you don't have an account, nothing you create or use (other than the automatic data collecting mentioned above) is saved.</li>
				<li><b>Opt-Out of Electronic Communications:</b> You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us. Just follow the instructions in those messages. If you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
				<li><b>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies:</b> At this time, ABCDEFG adheres to "do not track" signals across all of our Services. You can also usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using ABCDEFG's websites, with the drawback that certain features of ABCDEFG's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
				<li><b>Close Your Account:</b> While we hate to say goodbye, if you no longer want to use our Services, you can close your ABCDEFG.io account. You can close your account in your account settings - it just takes 3 confirmation clicks and all of your data will be permanently deleted.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			Your Rights
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you are located in certain countries, including those that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (AKA the "GDPR"), data protection laws give you rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:
			<ul>
				<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>
				<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>
				<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>
				<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and</li>
				<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>
			</ul>
			You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren't able to do that, or you would like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to How to Reach Us to, well, figure out how to reach us.
		</p>
		<p>
			EU individuals also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			Controllers and Responsible Companies
		</h2>
		<p>
			ABCDEFG's Services are worldwide. Google (Firebase) is the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			How to Reach Us
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you have a question about this Privacy Policy, or you would like to contact us about any of the rights mentioned in the Your Rights section above, please email email@ABCDEFG.com.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			Other Things You May Want to Know
		</h2>
		<p>
			Because ABCDEFG's Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use Information section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include:
			<ul>
				<li>In the case of US based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them, or ensuring they have signed up to the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank">EU-US Privacy Shield</a>; or</li>
				<li>In the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.</li>
			</ul>
			You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it from the EU.
		</p>
		<h4 class="mtop-md">
			Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others
		</h4>
		<p>
			If we ever decide to place ads on any of our Services, they may be delivered by advertising networks. Other parties may also provide analytics services via our Services. These ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services. These technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device. This information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver advertisements that may be more targeted to your interests. Please note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by ABCDEFG and does not cover the collection of information by any third party advertisers or analytics providers.
		</p>
		<h2 class="mtop-md">
			Privacy Policy Changes
		</h2>
		<p>
			Although most changes are likely to be minor, ABCDEFG may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. ABCDEFG encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by updating the version number and date at the top of the page, and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as adding a statement to your dashboard account, or sending you a notification through email). Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.
